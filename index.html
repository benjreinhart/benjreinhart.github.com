      I've spent the last couple of years at Groupon on multiple projects ranging from API-driven client side applications in JavaScript & CoffeeScript to backend APIs in Ruby and Clojure. My first year there I was primarily working as a front end developer on a large client side Backbone.js application. After that, I spent about a year working on a few Node.js applications that powered the main Groupon consumer experience. Since then I've been working on an internal API written in Clojure and backed by Elasticsearch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from Groupon, I like to contribute to open source and work on as many side projects as I can, some of which I throw on my github account (github.com/benjreinhart), others are private or internal at Groupon. I also take classes at DePaul in Chicago and on websites like Coursera and Udacity.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the past, I've mentored for StarterLeague (starterleague.com) as well as taught a multipart workshop on JavaScript there. I've presented at UXMad and the Chicago Node.js meetup.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not developing, I like to practice and play drums.
