		<h2><span class="mr-2">ðŸ‘‹</span> Hello, I'm Ben</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a software engineer living in San Francisco.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, I'm a co-founder at <a href="https://axilla.io">Axilla</a>, a YC-backed (S23) company.
			I was previously the first hire at <a href="https://privy.io">Privy</a>, working on authentication and end-to-end encryption APIs for data privacy.
			Before that, I was the tech lead for the data management platform at <a href="https://getcruise.com">Cruise</a>, which hosts the data used to train and evaluate models that drive cars.
		</p>
		<p>
			I moved to the bay area when my first startup was bought by <a href="https://nextdoor.com">Nextdoor</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Outside of work, I love to climb, pet dogs, and occasionally compete in triathlons.</p>
