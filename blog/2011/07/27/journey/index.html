<div class="entry-content"><p><em>Note: this post was originally written sometime in April and ported over on July 27th, 2011</em></p>

<p>Yesterday I was fortunate enough to go to the <a href="http://obtiva.com/">Obtiva</a> office for a personal tour by Obtiva’s founder, <a href="http://www.ktaylor.name/">Kevin Taylor</a>. Kevin is actually one of my professors at DePaul, he teaches a class on entrepreneurism and tech start ups. I was thrilled to go to Obtiva, mostly because it’s a development shop—they develop applications in house with a pretty good size team of seasoned developers—and because some of the people who work there are largely involved and respected in the industry.</p>

<p>The office was really nice and comfortable and I quickly met <a href="http://redsquirrel.com/dave/">Dave Hoover</a>, Chief Craftsman at Obtiva and author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382/">Apprenticeship Patterns</a></em>. I have followed Dave on Twitter for a while now and have really begun to respect his involvement in the community. He was very kind and gave me a copy of his book and signed it for me (thank you!). I also met <a href="http://railsrx.com/">Noel Rappin</a>, Senior Consultant at Obtiva and author of <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/nrtest/rails-test-prescriptions">Rails Test Prescriptions</a>. Kevin asked if he could give me a copy of his book as well, but luckily for him I already bought it.</p>

<p>After the tour, I was shocked when Kevin asked me if I’d like to sit down with the developers in the shop and work with them for as long as I’d like. I was thrilled even though unfortunately I knew I’d be of no help to them. Either way, I sat down for about an hour and observed, taking in what I could. It was cool to experience a respected development shop first hand.</p>

<p>I left and went to school, really excited to read my new book that Dave gave me. I spent the afternoon working on implementing a data structure (linked list) in C++ for my class. I was happy to finally get my program to work after struggling with it the previous week. I went home and after watching the Red Wings own the Coyotes I began to read Dave’s book.</p>

<p>Apprenticeship Patterns is a book catered towards beginners wishing to become software craftsman (me). It is meant to help beginners with their journey to becoming a ‘master’ in their craft (although, no one is ever a master). I am only on the second chapter but already the book resonates with me so well. I am one year into my journey and have mostly just figured out my ignorance when it comes to the limitless amount of knowledge it takes to become a craftsman in my field.</p>

<p>I really feel strongly that this is the right time for me to be reading this book considering it has already had such an impact on me. Much of what has been discussed so far has already been reflected in my (brief) career in one way or another. After feeling accomplished with some tedious C++ homework, this experience at Obtiva, and Dave’s book, I’m feeling more excited and confident than ever to begin my journey into the world of software craftsmanship.</p>
